## Objectives
-Identify and handle missing data.
-Correct inaccurate and inconsistent entries.
-Standardize data formats.
-Remove duplicate records.
-Ensure data integrity and accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies
1. Power Query and PowerBI

## Process
1. Data Collection: Gather raw data from various sources.
2. Data Inspection: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
3. Data Cleaning: Perform tasks such as filling missing values, correcting errors, and standardizing formats.
4. Data Validation: Verify the accuracy and integrity of the cleaned data.
5. Data Documentation: Document the cleaning process and the changes made to the dataset.

After cleaning, the dataset is ready for analysis and can be used to generate meaningful insights. The cleaned data is consistent, accurate, and free from errors.
